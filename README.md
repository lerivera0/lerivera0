### Hi there 👋

I'm Luis, a Full Stack developer with a special crush for back-end development. 
I am also a doctor, specialist in intensive care. After having established a career in critical medicine, I decided to turn into a full-time developer.

I am distinguished by my entrepreneurial spirit, my ability to analyze and solve problems, my versatility when adapting to new and complex situations, and my experience in communication and leadership of high-performance teams
